        <h3>SMIRNOV</h3> <p class="direction">[To LUKA.]</p> <p class="speech">Fool, you make too much noise! You're an ass!</p>
            <p class="direction">[_Discovering_ MRS. POPOV--_politely_.]</p> <p class="speech">Madam, I have the honor to
            introduce myself: Lieutenant in the Artillery, retired, country
            gentleman, Grigori Stepanovitch Smirnov! I'm compelled to bother you
            about an exceedingly important matter.</p>
        <h3>MRS. POPOV</h3> <p class="direction">[_Without offering her hand._]</p> <p class="speech">What is it you wish?</p>
        <h3>SMIRNOV</h3> <p class="speech">Your deceased husband, with whom I had the honor to be
            acquainted, left me two notes amounting to about twelve hundred
            roubles. Inasmuch as I have to pay the interest to-morrow on a loan from
            the Agrarian Bank, I should like to request, madam, that you pay me the
            money to-day.</p>
