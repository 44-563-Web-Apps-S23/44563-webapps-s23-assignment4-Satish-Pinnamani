        <h3>THE BOOR                   _Anton Tchekov_ </h3>
        <p><h6>LUKA</h6>. Oh, ma'am, some one is asking for you, insists on seeing you----</p><br>
        <p><h6>MRS. POPOV</h6>. You told him that since my husband's death I receive no one?</p><br>
        <p><h6>LUKA</h6>. I said so, but he won't listen; he says it is a pressing matter.</p><br>
        <p><h6>MRS. POPOV</h6>. I receive no one!</p><br>
        <p><h6>LUKA</h6>. I told him that, but he's a wild man; he swore and pushed himself into the room; he's in the dining-room now.</p>
        <p><h6>MRS. POPOV</h6>. <p>[_Excitedly._]</p> Good. Show him in. The impudent----!</p>
        <p>     [LUKA _goes out, centre_].</p><br>
        <p><h6></h6>MRS. POPOV</h6>. What a bore people are! What can they want with me? Why do
            they disturb my peace? <p>[_She sighs._]</p> Yes, it is clear I must enter a
            convent. <p>[_Meditatively._]</p> Yes, a convent.</p><br>
